		instructions:  'Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Carefully halve the pumpkin and scoop out the seeds (you can roast the seeds if you’d like—see note—but you won’t need them for this recipe). Slice each pumpkin halve in half to make quarters. Brush or rub 1 tablespoon olive oil over the flesh of the pumpkin and place the quarters, cut sides down, onto the baking sheet. Roast for 35 minutes or longer, until the orange flesh is easily pierced through with a fork. Set it aside to cool for a few minutes.Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add onion, garlic and salt to the skillet. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 8 to 10 minutes. In the meantime, peel the pumpkin skin off the pumpkins and discard the skin.Add the pumpkin flesh, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cayenne pepper (if using), and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper. Use your stirring spoon to break up the pumpkin a bit. Pour in the broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, to give the flavors time to meld.While the soup is cooking, toast the pepitas in a medium skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant, golden and making little popping noises. You want them to be nice and toasty, but not burnt. Transfer pepitas to a bowl to cool.Once the pumpkin mixture is done cooking, stir in the coconut milk and maple syrup. Remove the soup from heat and let it cool slightly. You can use an immersion blender to blend this soup in the pot. I prefer to use my stand blender, which yields the creamiest results—working in batches, transfer the contents of the pan to a blender (do not fill your blender past the maximum fill line!). Securely fasten the blender’s lid and use a kitchen towel to protect your hand from steam escaping from the top of the blender as you purée the mixture until smooth. Transfer the puréed soup to a serving bowl and repeat with the remaining batches.Taste and adjust if necessary (I thought the soup was just right as is, but you might want to add more coconut milk for extra creaminess/milder flavor, or maple syrup to make it a little sweeter).Ladle the soup into individual bowls. Sprinkle pepitas over the soup and serve. Let leftover soup cool completely before transferring it to a proper storage container and refrigerating it for up to 4 days (leftovers taste even better the next day!). Or, freeze this soup for up to 3 months.',

Drain, rinse them under cool water, and return them to the pot. Off the heat, toss the noodles with the sesame oil and salt, and set aside.Fill a shallow pan (a pie pan or 9″ round cake pan works great) with an inch of water. Fold a lint-free tea towel in half and place it next to the dish. Make sure your prepared fillings are within reach. Combine the green onion, cilantro and mint in a small bowl, and stir.Place one rice paper in the water and let it rest for about 20 seconds, give or take. You’ll learn to go by feel here—wait until the sheet is pliable but not super floppy. Carefully lay it flat on the towel.Leaving about 1 inch of open rice paper around the edges, cover the lower third of the paper with a few pieces of butter lettuce, followed by a small handful of rice noodles, some cabbage, and a few strips of carrot, cucumber and jalapeño. Sprinkle generously with the herb mix.Fold the lower edge up over the fillings, rolling upward just until the filling is compactly enclosed. Fold over the short sides like you would to make a burrito. Lastly, roll it up. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.To make the peanut sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, rice vinegar, tamari, honey, sesame oil, and garlic. Whisk in 2 to 3 tablespoons water, as needed to make a super creamy but dip-able sauce.Serve the spring rolls with peanut sauce on the side.

		instructions: ' Our Thai Peanut Curry is made with fresh vegetables, marinated tofu and a peanut sauce or broth made from scratch. It\'s easy to follow and shouldn\'t take longer than 40 minutes from start to end. Marinate the tofu. Cut a tofu block into cubes and prepare the marinade. In a small bowl mix soy sauce, cinnamon, turmeric, cumin, coriander powder, sweet paprika and sugar. Add the marinade to the tofu and leave it marinating while you chop the veggies. You can skip this part if you\'re short of time, and just pan fry the tofu with the rest of the vegetables. Marinating the tofu makes it extra tasty and will bring more flavour to your curry. Chop the veggies. For our peanut curry you can add any vegetables that you like or may have at home. For curries, we especially like broccoli, bell peppers, baby corn, zucchini or carrots. Prepare the sauce. Heat some oil in a pan and add finely chopped garlic, onion, red chillies, ginger and carrot. Stir fry for a couple of minutes and transfer into a big jug. Add 500ml of vegetable stock, crushed peanuts or peanut butter, sugar and soy sauce. Blend all the ingredients until you have a smooth sauce. If you prefer to use a store-bought paste, this is the brand we recommend you buy. Cook the curry. Heat some oil in a big pan or pot and add the chopped vegetables and the marinated tofu. Cook for a couple of minutes until the vegetables start to turn golden. Add the peanut sauce and coconut milk. Bring to simmer and leave simmering for about 15 minutes. Adjust with salt and pepper and your curry will be ready to enjoy.',

Simmer until the sweet potatoes are almost falling apart and the lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. The liquid should also be reduced by almost a third. Add the coconut milk and kale to the pot and stir. Place the lid on top and continue to simmer the stew until the kale is wilted and bright green, about 3-4 minutes. Season the sweet potato and coconut milk stew again with salt and pepper. Bring the stew back up to a strong simmer and check for seasoning. Adjust with more salt, pepper, chili etc. if necessary.

		instructions: 'First we will go over the important information for each individual ingredient: Since shrimp tempura is getting mainstream, many American grocery stores (Trader Joe’s, Costco, etc) carry frozen shrimp tempura at the seafood section. The frozen shrimp tempura tends to be extra crunchy, so it’s perfect for making dragon roll at home. You just need to pop them in an oven (or toaster oven) for 20 minutes or so, while you do most of the prep work. Of course, you can make them from scratch, and here’s my Shrimp Tempura recipe. You’ll need 2 shrimp tempuras for each roll you plan to make. To choose the perfect avocado for immediate use, look for the ones with darker colored skin. Then gently squeeze the fruit in the palm of your hand. If the avocado yields to firm gentle pressure, it’s ready-to-eat. If the avocado does not yield to gentle pressure, it is considered still “firm” and will ripen in a couple of days. If the avocado feels mushy or very soft to the touch it may be very ripe to overripe. I use Japanese cucumbers which are long and slender. They have few seeds so it’s perfect for sushi rolls. If you can’t find Japanese cucumbers, then use Persian cucumbers are quite similar so they are a great substitute. If you use English cucumbers, then cut in half lengthwise and remove the seeds with a spoon as they yield too much water inside the rolls. I do not recommend using typical American cucumbers as they have waxy thick skin and too many seeds inside. The word “sushi rice” is sometimes used to refer to Japanese short-grain rice outside of Japan, but in Japanese cooking, Sushi Rice (酢飯) means steamed rice that has been seasoned with sushi vinegar and only used for all types of sushi recipes.Perfectly prepared sushi rice is very important in sushi making. Here are a few things to take note: You’ll need Japanese short-grain rice (I use Koshihikari), cook it well, and season with sushi vinegar. Read my step-by-step tutorial on how to cook sushi rice.Please DO NOT mash the sushi rice when you place it on the nori sheet. You should be able to see individual rice kernel, not mushy rice in the roll.Do not overfill the roll with rice. It’s important to balance to ratio of rice and the fillings. My quick tip is to use a ½-cup measuring cup to fill the rice before you assemble your rolls. That should be enough for half a sheet of nori. With a consistent amount of sushi rice for each roll, all of your sushi rolls will be of even size! I use only half a sheet of nori for my recipe and it is sufficient to roll. If you found the nori a little too short, cut down the filling slightly. Keep practicing and you should be able to find the perfect ratio for rolling. All you need is two ingredients for this amazing sauce! It’s creamy, sweet, tangy with the right amount of heat. Please use Japanese mayonnaise for the best flavor. You can buy it from Amazon. The Japanese mayo is essential to make Japanese Potato Salad, Sesame Dressing, Mentaiko Pasta, Okonomiyaki, Casesar Salad, and more! Just a few spoonfuls of unagi sauce gives an extra flavorful boost to the dragon roll. If you can’t find a bottle of unagi (eel) sauce from your local Japanese grocery store, try my Homemade Unagi Sauce recipe. It is totally worth making from scratch, especially if you love making Unadon (Unagi Donburi) or Yaki Onigiri. It’s a good condiment to have in your fridge at all times. Now, here are the step by step instructions on how to make the rolls: 1. Gather all the ingredients. 2. Cut cucumber lengthwise into quarters. Remove the seeds and then cut in half lengthwise. 3. Cut the avocado in half lengthwise around the seed and twist the two halves until they separate. Hack the knife edge into the pit. Hold the skin of the avocado with the other hand and twist in counter directions. The pit will come out smoothly. Remove the skin and slice the avocado widthwise. Gently press the avocado slices with your fingers and then keep pressing gently and evenly with the side of the knife until the length of avocado is about the length of sushi roll (length of nori seaweed). If you don\'t serve the sushi roll right away, I recommend squeezing lemon over the avocado to prevent discoloration. 4. Wrap the bamboo mat with plastic wrap and place half of the nori sheet, shiny side down. Dip your hands in tezu (vinegar water) and spread ½ cup sushi rice over the nori sheet. 5. Turn it over and put the shrimp tempura, cucumber strips, and tobiko at the bottom end of the nori sheet. If you like to put unagi, place inside here as well. 6. From the bottom end, start rolling nori sheet over the filling tightly and firmly with bamboo mat until the bottom end reaches the nori sheet. Lift the bamboo mat and roll over. Place the bamboo mat over the roll and tightly squeeze the roll. 7. Using the side of the knife, place the avocado on top of the roll. 8. Place plastic wrap over the roll and then put the bamboo mat over. Tightly squeeze the roll until the avocado slices wrap around the sushi. Be gentle so you won’t break the avocado slices. 9. Cut the roll into 8 pieces with the knife. Clean knife with a wet towel after each cut. If the roll got messy while cutting, tightly squeeze the sushi roll again with the bamboo mat. Remove the plastic wrap on top of the sushi and transfer it to a serving plate. 10. Put tobiko on each piece of sushi and drizzle spicy mayo and sprinkle black sesame seeds on top. If you like, place some unagi sauce on the plate so you can dip the sushi. Enjoy!',

		thumbnail: 'thumbnail10',
		instructions: 'Make the Chocolate Mousse: In a medium saucepan, whisk together 1+½ cups heavy cream, egg yolks, and sugar and cook over medium heat for about 1-2 minutes until it coats the back of a spoon. Do not boil at any time. Remove from heat and continue whisking about 1 minute. Add melted chocolate and whisk consistently. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely. If your chocolate ganache breaks, then read the blog post above to know how to fix the ganache easily. Preheat oven to 350°F/175°C. Line the bottom and the sides of a 9" / 23cm baking pan with parchment paper. Set aside. Make the chocolate cake layer: In a medium bowl combine flour, cocoa, sugar, baking powder, and salt and stir to combine. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl with a stand or handheld mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat oil, egg, buttermilk, and vanilla* just until combined. Stir in dry ingredients to combine. Slowly mix in hot cocoa until combined. The batter will be thin. Transfer batter to the prepared baking pan. Bake for 16-18 minutes or until a toothpick in the center comes out clean. Don\'t overbake. I baked mine for 18 minutes. Let cool in the pan for about 20 minutes. Then open the springform pan and let cool to room temperature. Continue with the Chocolate Mousse: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk 1+½ cups heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar and whisk until stiff peaks form. Stir about ¼ of whipped cream into the cooled chocolate cream with a whisk. Then gently fold in the remaining whipped cream with a wooden spoon. Assemble the cake: Cut a thin layer off the top of your cake to create a flat surface. Close the springform pan again. Spread the chocolate mousse evenly on top of the cake layer. Chill overnight in an airtight container in the fridge. Make the chocolate glaze: Place chopped chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Place heavy cream in another heatproof bowl and microwave until very hot, almost boiling for about 1-2 minutes. Pour over chocolate and let stand 1-2 minutes. Whisk until smooth, and the chocolate is completely melted. Let cool in the fridge for about 10-15 minutes that it thickens. Test the consistency of the glaze down the side of the bowl. It should drip. The longer it stands, the thicker it gets. If it is too firm, re-warm it a few seconds in the microwave. Once it reached the desired consistency, it\'s ready to spoon on top of the cake. Remove cake from the fridge and spoon the glaze little by little around the sides and let drip off the sides. Do this with a small spoon and do one drip at the time. Then spoon or pour the rest of the glaze on top of the cake (maybe you don\'t need all) and level with an offset spatula. Place cake in the fridge for 15 minutes that the glaze gets firm if needed. Decorate with grated chocolate and berries if desired or to your preference. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge up to 3 days. ',

Tip: we simply picked out the freeze-dried berries from our box of cereal. Place the dish in the freezer for at least 3 hours, or until the yogurt is frozen. Remove from the freezer and let it come to room temperature for about 5 minutes to soften slightly so that it cuts more easily. Cut into bars and transfer to an airtight container, using pieces of parchment to separate the pieces. Store in the freezer until ready to eat. Let your bar thaw slightly before eating so that the yogurt softens. Enjoy!',
